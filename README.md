# Project 1: HTML Code Development

## Requirements

As part of your training, you are assigned to develop an HTML document based on a provided design. Please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure successful completion of the task:

1. **HTML Document Only**: Focus solely on creating the HTML document. Do not include any CSS or JavaScript code.

2. **Logical HTML with Proper Document Structuring**: Write logical HTML code with proper structuring. Follow HTML5 standards to ensure your document is well-organized and semantic.

3. **Validate Your HTML Code**: Before committing any code to the repository, validate your HTML using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). Correct any issues that are identified to ensure compliance with web standards.

4. **No CSS**: Do not write any CSS code. This task is focused purely on HTML development.

5. **Learn and Apply HTML Concepts**: Utilize resources from [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) to understand HTML concepts thoroughly. Apply these concepts accurately in your code.

6. **Use Any Editor of Your Choice**: You are free to use any code editor you are comfortable with for this task.

7. **Daily Code Commits**: Commit your code daily to the provided repository: [Credera-in-2024 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ranveerkumar/credera-in-2024). Share your GitHub account name with Vinay or Kasafa to get access to the repository.

8. **Timeline**: The project timeline is 3 weeks, including iterations of code reviews and fixes. If you need more time, please reach out to our team as soon as possible.
9. . **GIT Commands**: Learn and use Git commands to commit the code. Accessing the Github portal and uploading your code is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

Feel free to contact our team if you have any questions or need further assistance.

## Guidelines
### Development
1. **Design**: Assess the design provided to you. Understand and try to estimate it, if you feel that it might take some more time than provided - please feel free to reach out to the team.
2. **HTML Development**: Develop only HTML, with following points in mind:
   1. Write your own code
   2. Use appropriate tags, and follow logical usage.
   3. Develop properly structured HTML document
   4. Don't use any deprecated tags and/or attribute.
   5. Don't use any tag for formatting or look & feel purposes.
   6. Always validate your HTML using [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

#### What not to do (STRICTLY)
1. No CSS required for this project, so let's not worry about how the page appears in the Web Browser.
2. Not committing code for more than 2 days
3. Not asking questions in case of any blocker, confusion or clarification required.

### Code Commit
1. We highly encourage to use git command line tool and use git commands rather than a GUI tools. You might need to have appropriate Git software installed on your machine (depends on the OS).
2. Create your own branch with your name (one time activity) right after you clone this repository.
3. Push your newly created branch to the remote (one time activity).
4. Commit & Push your code changes to your branch on regular interval to avoid any code loss. Of course, Git maintains all your committed version and allows you to compare and roll-back etc.
5. We don't need to merge anything to Master, so we should be fine with only Commit and Push.
